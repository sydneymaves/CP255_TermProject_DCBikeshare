# CP255 Urban Informatics Term Project: Analyzing Safety and Equity Implications of Bikeshare Locations in Washington, D.C.
Created by Sydney Maves | 5.9.2022

## Research Idea
Since the COVID-19 pandemic as more people have begun to work-from-home and and as leisure and social activities have changed, there has been more unpredictability in travel patterns. Peak commute times have become more spread throughout the day, and modal shifts have also occurred.

In this project, I will be exploring Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare dataset to understand geographically where Capital Bikeshare riders are going to and from in order to recommend station improvements and expansions. This project will focus primarily on two important aspects of a bikeshare system - safety and equity - to propose locations which foster safety for this vulnerable user type as well as increases in accessibility for users who need it most. To this end, this research will work to recommend bikeshare location changes to ensure that station locations are not encouraging bikeshare users to ride along the city's high injury network as well as new station locations which improve equity and support emerging travel behavior trends (resulting from COVID).

## Guiding Research Questions

Capital Bikeshare Data: For this project, I will am utilizing one year of data from March 2021 through February 2022. By using one year's worth of data, I will be able to explore seasonal variations in ridership patterns.
